kxstudio-menu

This is a simple set of files that will divide your desktop multimedia menu into 7 categories:
 - Audio Plugins
 - Audio Production
 - Audio Tools
 - Disc Production
 - Hardware Configuration
 - Media Players
 - Video Production

This module was specially made for users that install a lot of apps, so the multimedia menu becomes too big...


To install just do the usual '[sudo] make install'.

If your distro does not follow '/etc/X11/Xsession.d/' rules, insert this new line into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile:
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/usr/share/kxstudio/menu:/etc/xdg
