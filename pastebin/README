This folder contains the code for KXStudio's Pastebin.

It's shared under the Public Domain.

To use it, download GeSHi first, and unpack the geshi folder in here.

The file structure must be like this:
 + geshi/<some-php-files>
 - repo/
 + repo/_error
 - .htaccess
 - download.php
 - geshi.php
 - index.php
 - kxstudio.css

NOTE:
 -> htaccess has been renamed as usual
 -> repo directory must have r+w permissions (we'll use it to store the files)


To make this work, you'll need to:

edit index/download.php and set $base_dir and $server_dir properly.
edit index.php and set the server root path if needed (ie, href="/paste/kxstudio.css" -> href="/home/http/public_html/paste/kxstudio.css")
^ change everything that starts with '/paste'.
